descr = """StructuralGT_RC: An automated python package for graph theory analysis of structural networks.\n
Designed for processing digital micrographs of complex network materials.\n
For example, analyzing SEM images of polymer network.\n

StructuralGT_RC is designed as an easy-to-use python-based application for applying graph theory (GT) analysis to 
structural networks of a wide variety of material systems. This is the same software as StructuralGT, except with the 
added functionality to perform Ricci Curvature calculation.  The two versions are separated due to issues with some 
systems installing the dependency NetworKit. This application converts digital images of nano-/micro-/macro-scale 
structures into a graph theoretical representation of the structure in the image consisting of nodes and the edges 
that connect them. Fibers (or fiber-like structures) are taken to represent edges, and the location where a fiber 
branches, or 2 or more fibers intersect are taken to represent nodes. The program operates with a graphical user 
interface (GUI) so that selecting images and processing the graphs are intuitive and accessible to anyone, regardless 
of programming experience.  Detection of networks from input images, the extraction of the graph object, and the 
subsequent GT analysis of the graph is handled entirely from the GUI, and a PDF file with the results of the analysis 
is saved.

\nSee the README for detail information.\n
